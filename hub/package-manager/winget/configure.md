# configure command (winget)

The **configure** command of the [winget](./index.md) tool uses a [WinGet Configuration file](../configuration/index.md) to begin setting up your Windows machine to a desired development environment state.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> WinGet Configuration is currently in preview. To use a WinGet Configuration file with the [`winget configure` command](../winget/configure.md), you must first [enable the experimental configuration feature](../configuration/index.md#enable-the-winget-configuration-experimental-configuration-preview-feature).

> [!WARNING]
> Do not run a WinGet Configuration file without first reviewing the contents of the file and verifying the credibility of the related resources. See [How to check the trustworthiness of a WinGet Configuration file](../configuration/check.md).

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10 RS5 or later, and Windows 11.
- Winget version v1.5.1572 or later.

## Usage

`winget configure -f <C:/Users/<username>/winget-configs/config-file-name.dsc.yaml>`

Once you have identified the winget configuration file that you are interested in using, confirmed the safety and trustworthiness of that file, and downloaded the file to your local machine, you can use the `winget configure` command to  initiate the set up of your configuration.
