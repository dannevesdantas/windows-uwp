## Preview Pane

Preview Pane is an existing feature in the Windows File Explorer which shows a lightweight, rich, read-only preview of the file's contents in the view's reading pane. PowerToys adds four extensions: Markdown, SVG, PDF, and G-code. PowerToys also adds support for source code files (for more than 150 file extensions).

### Enabling Preview Pane

To enable, first ensure that in the PowerToys Settings all are set to **On**.

> [!NOTE]
> Windows Explorer has an additional setting that needs to be checked in order for preview handlers to work. Open Explorer's Folder options, go to tab "View", under "Advanced settings" check **Show preview handlers in preview pane**.

**Windows 10:**

Next, in Windows 10, open Windows File Explorer, select the **View** tab in the File Explorer ribbon, and then select **Preview Pane**.
