# FancyZones utility

FancyZones is a window manager utility for arranging and snapping windows into efficient layouts to improve the speed of your workflow and restore layouts quickly. FancyZones allows the user to define a set of window locations for a desktop that are drag targets for windows. When the user drags a window into a zone, the window is resized and repositioned to fill that zone.

## Getting started snapping windows

If two zones are adjacent, a window can be snapped to the sum of their area (rounded to the minimum rectangle that contains both). When the mouse cursor is near the common edge of two zones, both zones are activated simultaneously, allowing you to drop the window into both zones.

It's also possible to snap to any number of zones. First, drag the window until one zone is activated, then press and hold the <kbd>Control</kbd> key while dragging the window to select multiple zones.

To snap a window to multiple zones using only the keyboard, first turn on the setting **Override Windows Snap** and select **Move windows based on: Relative position** as shown below. After snapping a window to one zone, use <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>[arrows]</kbd> to expand the window to multiple zones.

## Window Switching

When two or more windows are snapped in the same zone, users can cycle between the snapped windows in that zone by using the shortcut <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>PgUp/PgDn</kbd>.

## Shortcut Keys

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| <kbd>⊞ Win</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd> | Launches the editor (this shortcut can be changed in the Settings window) |
| <kbd>⊞ Win</kbd>+<kbd>left/right</kbd> | Move focused window between zones (only if **Override Windows Snap hotkeys** setting is turned on, in that case only the <kbd>⊞ Win</kbd>+<kbd>←</kbd> and <kbd>⊞ Win</kbd>+<kbd>→</kbd> are overridden, while the <kbd>⊞ Win</kbd>+<kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>⊞ Win</kbd>+<kbd>↓</kbd> keep working as usual) |

FancyZones doesn't override the Windows <kbd>⊞ Win</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>arrow</kbd> to quickly move a window to an adjacent monitor.

## Getting started with the editor

### Launch zones editor

Launch the zones editor using the button in the PowerToys Settings menu or by pressing <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>`</kbd> ("back-tick" or "accent grave"; note that this shortcut can be changed in the settings dialog).  

> [!NOTE]
> Previous to PowerToys v0.39, this shortcut was <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>`</kbd> without Shift. This was updated so that it does not conflict with [Windows Terminal Quake mode](/windows/terminal/tips-and-tricks#quake-mode) shortcut.

### Snapping apps with elevated permission

If you have applications that are elevated (such as Windows Terminal or Task Manager) and want them snapped with FancyZones, run PowerToys in administrator mode. Read [PowerToys and running as administrator](administrator.md) for more information.

## Choose your layout (Layout Editor)

When first launched, the zones editor presents a list of layouts that can be adjusted by how many windows are on the monitor. Choosing a layout shows a preview of that layout on the monitor. The selected layout is applied automatically. Double-clicking the layout will apply it and automatically close the editor.

If multiple displays are in use, the editor will detect the available monitors and display them for the user to choose between. The chosen monitor will then be the target of the selected layout.

### Space around zones

The **Show space around zones** check box enables you to determine what sort of margin will surround each FancyZone window. The **Space around zones** field enables you to set a custom value for the width of the margin. With the Zones Editor open, change the **Show space around zones** after changing the values to see the new value applied.

The **Distance to highlight adjacent zones** enables you to set a custom value for the amount of space between zones until they snap together, or before both are highlighted enabling them to merge together.

### Creating a custom layout

The zones editor also supports creating and saving custom layouts. Select the <kbd>+ Create new layout</kbd> button at the bottom-right.
  
There are two ways to create custom zone layouts: **Grid** layout and **Canvas** layout. 

The **Grid** model starts with a three column grid and allows zones to be created by splitting and merging zones, resizing the gutter between zones as desired. This is a relative layout and will resize with different screen sizes.

- To divide a zone, just click your mouse.  To rotate the divider, just hold down the <kbd>shift</kbd> key. 
- To move a divider, click on the thumb and drag.
- To merge zones, select and hold the left mouse button and drag the mouse until multiple zones are selected, then release the button and a popup menu will show up.  Click "Merge" and they will become one big zone. This is how a zone would be deleted, by merging it into another zone.

The **Canvas** model starts with a blank layout and supports adding zones that can be dragged and resized similar to windows. Canvas layouts are directly tied to DPI and resolution of the monitor.

Canvas layout also has keyboard support for zone editing. Use the <kbd>arrow</kbd> keys (up, down, left, right) to move a zone by 10 pixels, or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>arrow</kbd> to move a zone by 1 pixel. Use the <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>arrow</kbd> keys to resize a zone by 10 pixels (5 per edge), or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>arrow</kbd> to resize a zone by 2 pixels (1 per edge). To switch between the editor and dialog, press the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> keys.

### Quickly changing between custom layouts

With a custom layout, this layout can be configured to a user-defined hotkey to quickly apply it to the desired desktop. The hotkey can be set by opening the custom layout's edit menu. Once set, the custom layout can be applied by pressing the <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>[number]</kbd> binding. The layout can also be applied by pressing the hotkey when dragging a window.

In the demo below, we start with a default template applied to the screen and 2 custom layouts that we assign hotkeys for. We then use the <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>[number]</kbd> binding to apply the first custom layout and snap a window to it. Finally, we apply the second custom layout while dragging a window and snap the window to it.

> [!TIP]
> The settings for the zone layouts and monitors are saved in file `%LocalAppData%\Microsoft\PowerToys\FancyZones\zones-settings.json`. This can be manually changed to tweak zones, and exported to share layouts across devices.

## Settings

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Configure the zone editor hotkey | To change the default hotkey, click on the textbox and then press the desired key combination on your keyboard (it's not necessary to select or delete the text) |
| Follow mouse cursor instead of focus when launching editor in a multi-monitor environment | When checked, the editor will launch on the monitor where the mouse cursor is. When unchecked, the editor will launch on the monitor where the current active window is |
| Hold Shift key to activate zones while dragging | Toggles between auto-snap mode with the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key (disabling snapping during a drag) and manual snap mode where pressing the shift key during a drag enables snapping |
| Use a non-primary mouse button to toggle zone activation | Clicking a non-primary mouse button toggles the zones activation |
| Show zones on all monitors while dragging a window | By default, FancyZones shows only the zones available on the current monitor. (This feature may have a performance impact when checked) |
| Allow zones to span across monitors (all monitors must have the same DPI scaling) | Allows to treat all connected monitors as one large screen. To work correctly, it requires all monitors to have the same DPI scaling factor (there might be unexpected effects when using monitors in different orientations) |
| Override Windows Snap hotkeys (Win + arrow) to move between zones | When this option is checked and FancyZones is running, it overrides two Windows Snap keys: <kbd>⊞ Win</kbd>+<kbd>left</kbd> and <kbd>⊞ Win</kbd>+<kbd>right</kbd> |
| Move windows based on their position | Allows to use <kbd>⊞ Win</kbd>+<kbd>arrows</kbd> to snap a window based on its position relatively to the zone layout |
| Move windows between zones across all monitors | Unchecked: snapping with <kbd>⊞ Win</kbd>+<kbd>arrow</kbd> cycles the window through the zones on the current monitor.<br/>Checked: it cycles the window through all the zones on all monitors |
| Keep windows in their zones when the screen resolution changes | FancyZones will resize and reposition windows into the zones they were previously in after a screen resolution change |
| During zone layout changes, windows assigned to a zone will match new size/position | FancyZones will resize and position windows into the new zone layout by maintaining the previous zone number location of each window |
| Move newly created windows to the last known zone | Automatically move a newly opened window into the last zone location that application was in |
| Move newly created windows to the current active monitor [experimental] | When this option is checked, and **Move newly created windows to the last known zone** is unchecked or the application doesn't have a last known zone, it keeps the application on the current active monitor |
| Restore the original size of windows when unsnapping | Unsnapping a window will restore its size as before it was snapped |
| Make dragged window transparent | When the zones are activated, the window being dragged is made transparent to improve the zones visibility |
| Enable quick layout switch | Enables hotkeys to quickly changes layouts - see individual layout settings |
| Flash zones when switching layout | The zones will flash when a layout is selected via the shortcut |
| Zone highlight color | The color of a zone when it is the active drop target during a window drag |
| Zone Inactive color | The color of zones when they are not an active drop during a window drag |
| Zone border color | The color of the border of active and inactive zones |
| Zone opacity (%) | The percentage of opacity of active and inactive zones (default: 50%) |
| Exclude applications from snapping to zones | Add the application's name, or part of the name, one per line (e.g. adding `Notepad` will match both `Notepad.exe` and `Notepad++.exe`; to match only `Notepad.exe` add the `.exe` extension) |
