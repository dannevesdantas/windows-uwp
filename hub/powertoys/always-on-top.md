### Toggle windows to be on top

With the activation / deactivation shortcut (default: <kbd>âŠž Win</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>), the window will be toggled on top.

## PowerToys settings

From the settings menu, the following options can be configured:

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Activation shortcut | The customizable keyboard command to turn on or off always on top for that window |
| Do not activate when Game Mode is on | Prevents the feature from being activated when actively playing a game on the system |
| Color | The color of the highlight border |
| Border thickness (px)| The thickness of the highlight border - Measured in pixels |
| Play a sound | A small alert chirp is played to make you aware.  Activating and deactivating are different so you can tell. |
| Excluded apps | Add the application's name, or part of the name, one per line (e.g. adding `Notepad` will match both `Notepad.exe` and `Notepad++.exe`; to match only `Notepad.exe` add the `.exe` extension) |
