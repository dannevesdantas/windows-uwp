You can make changes to a published app's add-on at any time. To submit updates, go to the application's page in Partner Center and click  **Update** on the right-hand side for your app submission that’s live on the Store. This will create a new submission for the application, using the info from your previous submission as a starting point. 

Go to the required sections of app add-on like [Pricing and availability](../../../apps/publish/publish-your-app/price-and-availability.md), [Properties](../../../apps/publish/publish-your-app/enter-app-properties.md), [Store listing](../../../apps/publish/publish-your-app/create-app-store-listing.md) and [Submission options](../../../apps/publish/publish-your-app/manage-submission-options.md) to make the changes you'd like and save them. Then click  **Submit** on Overview page.
