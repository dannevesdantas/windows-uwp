# Close your developer account in Partner Center

Developer accounts don't expire, so there's no need to renew your account in order to keep it open. If you decide to close your account completely, you can do so by contacting support.

When you close your account, it's important to understand what happens to any app that you have published in the Microsoft Store:

- Your app's current customers can still use the app. However, they can't make in-app purchases.
- Even though the app is still available to customers who have previously acquired it, your app listing is removed from Microsoft Store. No new customers can acquire your app.
- Your app's name will be released for potential use by another developer.
- If you have a balance due from previous app sales, you can request payment for that balance even if the amount due doesn't meet the standard payment threshold.
