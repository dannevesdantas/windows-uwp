# Windows UI Library 2 Release Notes

The Windows UI Library (WinUI) is an open source project hosted on GitHub. All new releases are built from the [Windows UI Library GitHub repo](https://aka.ms/winui).

We encourage you to file bug reports, feature requests and community code contributions in the [Windows UI Library repo](https://aka.ms/winui).

WinUI includes two NuGet packages:

* [Microsoft.UI.Xaml](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.UI.Xaml): Controls and Fluent Design for UWP apps. This is the main WinUI package.

* [Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Core.Direct](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Core.Direct): Low-level APIs for use in middleware components.

You can download and use WinUI packages in your app using the NuGet package manager: see [Getting Started with the Windows UI Library](/uwp/toolkits/winui/getting-started) for more information.

## Examples

The **XAML Controls Gallery** sample app includes interactive demos and sample code for most WinUI features and controls.

If you have the **XAML Controls Gallery** app installed and updated to the latest version, [see the controls in action](xamlcontrolsgallery:).

If you don't have the XAML Controls Gallery app installed, get it from the [Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/xamlgalleryapp).

You can also view, clone, and build the XAML Controls Gallery source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery).

## Documentation

How-to articles for Windows UI Library controls are included with the [Universal Windows Platform controls documentation](/windows/uwp/design/controls-and-patterns/).

API reference docs are located here: [Windows UI Library APIs](/windows/winui/api/).
