# Windows UI Library (WinUI) 3

:::image type="content" source="../../images/platforms-winui3.png" alt-text="Diagram of WinUI 3 platform support":::

WinUI 3 is the native UI platform component that ships with the [Windows App SDK](../../windows-app-sdk/index.md) (completely decoupled from [Windows 10 and later SDKs](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/)). The Windows App SDK provides a unified set of APIs and tools that can be used to create production desktop apps that target Windows 10 and later, and can be published to the Microsoft Store.

> [!Important]
> The **Windows App SDK** was previously known as **Project Reunion**. Some assets, such as the VSIX extension and NuGet packages, still use this code name (these will be renamed in a future release).
>
>**Windows App SDK** is used in all documentation except where a specific release or asset still refers to **Project Reunion**.
