# C# interop APIs for WinUI

As a C# desktop application developer, in .NET 5 and later you can make use of C# interop classes whose methods wrap and represent several interoperability functions. These include methods of C# classes representing the [GetWindowIdFromWindow](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/win32/microsoft.ui.interop/nf-microsoft-ui-interop-getwindowidfromwindow) function, for example.

These C# interop classes are available in .NET 5 and later as part of the [Windows App SDK](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/).
