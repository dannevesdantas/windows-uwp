# Render text with DWriteCore 

DWriteCore is the [Windows App SDK](index.md) implementation of [DirectWrite](/windows/win32/directwrite/direct-write-portal) (DirectWrite is the DirectX API for high-quality text rendering, resolution-independent outline fonts, and full Unicode text and layout support).

DWriteCore provides access to all current DirectWrite features for text rendering, including a device-independent text layout system, hardware-accelerated text, multi-format text, and wide language support.

For more details about DWriteCore&mdash;including guidance for setting up your development environment, and code examples for programming with it&mdash;see [DWriteCore overview](/windows/win32/directwrite/dwritecore-overview) in the DirectWrite documentation.
