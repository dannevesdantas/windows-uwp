# Manage your MSI or EXE app's store listing

> [!NOTE]
> MSI and EXE support in the Microsoft Store is currently in a limited public preview phase. As the size of the preview expands, we'll be adding new participants from the wait list. To join the wait list, click [here](https://aka.ms/storepreviewwaitlist).

## Link to your app's listing

The direct link to your app's page can be shared to help your customers find the app in the Store. This link is in the format `https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/<your app's Store ID>`. When a customer clicks this link, it opens the web-based listing page for your app. On Windows devices, the Store app will also launch and display your app's listing.

Your app's Store ID is also shown in this section. This Store ID can be used to [generate Store badges](https://developer.microsoft.com/store/badges) or otherwise identify your app.

You can help customers discover your app by linking to your app's listing in the Microsoft Store.

### Linking to your app's Store listing with the Microsoft Store badge

You can link directly to your app's listing with a custom badge to let customers know your app is in the Microsoft Store.

To create your badge, visit the [Microsoft Store badges](https://developer.microsoft.com/store/badges) page. You'll need to have your app's 12-character Store ID to generate the badge and link.

> [!NOTE]
> See [App marketing guidelines](../app-marketing-guidelines.md) for info and requirements related to your use of the Microsoft Store badge.

### Linking directly to your app in the Microsoft Store

The Store protocol link can be used to link directly to your app in the Store without opening a browser by using the ms-windows-store: URI scheme.

These links are useful if you know your users are on a Windows device and you want them to arrive directly at the listing page in the Store. For example, you might want to use this link after checking user agent strings in a browser to confirm that the user's operating system supports the Store.

To use this URI scheme to link directly to your app's Store listing, append your app's Store ID to this link:

`ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=<your app's Store ID>`

## Removing your app from the Microsoft Store

### Delete your app

To completely remove an app **draft** from Partner Center (and release all the names reserved for that app), you can delete your appâ€¯from the app overview page. Note that if you have already published the app to the Store, you cannot delete it from Partner Center.

### Make your app unavailable

You can stop offering an app to any new customers through from its overview page. After you've made your app unavailable, it will no longer be visible in the Store after several hours. You can make your app available again at any time.

> [!NOTE]
> Any customers who already have the app will still be able to use and download it.
