# Age ratings for MSI and EXE apps

The **Age ratings** page of the [app submission process](app-submissions.md) lets you provide information about your app so it can receive the appropriate age and content ratings administered by the [International Age Ratings Coalition (IARC)](https://www.globalratings.com/) rating system. These ratings are about the suitability of the content in the app, rather than the age of the target audience for your app.

## Answering the age ratings questionnaire

The first time you submit an app (or the first time you update an app published using the older age rating process), you will be prompted to complete a multiple-choice questionnaire to determine your app’s age rating.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have already completed the questionnaire for your app in another storefront and have an IARC rating ID, you can select the option to provide us with your rating ID. We'll use your ID to associate the existing ratings with your app in the Microsoft Store.

You are required to answer the questions accurately. As part of this process, we share your publisher display name and email address with IARC. After you complete the questionnaire, the IARC rating system will provide age and content rating information based on your responses. We’ll use this rating information when displaying your app to customers in different markets. You will also receive an email from IARC with a confirmation of the app’s rating when your app has been published. For more info about any question, click the info icon that appears next to it.

The first question asks you to choose the category that best describes your app (and its metadata). Based on your answer to this question, you'll be presented with additional questions related to the category you selected. To get more details that may help you understand how to answer any question, click the info icon next to that question. If you make a mistake, you can go back or start the questionnaire again to provide the right answers.

When you have completed the questionnaire, click **Save and generate**. You’ll then see all of the app’s assigned ratings, and can continue with your submission. You can also click **Edit** to correct any of your answers to the questionnaire.

Once your app has been assigned a rating, that same rating will be used for all subsequent updates you publish for that app. If an update contains content that may change your app's rating, you can retake the questionnaire by clicking the **Edit** button. IARC may also update the questions from time to time. If this happens, you may be prompted to complete the questionnaire again when you submit an update.

## Appealing ratings or refused classifications

If you have questions about the age rating your app received, or wish to appeal it, you can contact IARC via the link that appears in the rating certificate email that you will receive after your app has been published.

In some cases, the rating for your app may cause it to be classified as inappropriate for a particular country or region. If this occurs, you will see a message indicating the market(s) to which your app can’t be offered. If you disagree with this classification (or any other for that matter), you can request an appeal using the link that appears in the rating certificate email that you will receive from IARC.
